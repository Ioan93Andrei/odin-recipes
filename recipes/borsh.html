                <strong><h3 id="section">Steps:</h3></strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a large, thick-bottomed pot on medium high heat. Add the shank slice or stew beef. Let the beef brown lightly on one side, then turn over.</li>
                    <li>Add the chopped onions to the pot. Let the onions cook and soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Pour 4 cups of the beef broth over the beef and onions in the pot. Bring to a boil. Lower the heat to a simmer.</li>
                    <li>Cover and cook until the meat is falling-off-the-bone tender, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.</li>
                    <li>Peel and chop the beets, carrots, and potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces.</li>
                    <li>Toss the beets and carrots with a teaspoon or two of olive oil and spread them out in a single layer on a foil lined roasting pan.</li>
                    <li>Roast in preheated oven for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Toss the potatoes with olive oil and make room for them in the roasting pan, and roast everything an additional 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Once the beef has cooked through until tender, remove from the pot, and take the pot off the heat. If you are using a beef shank, remove and discard any bone, connective tissue, and excess fat. Chop the meat into bite sized pieces.</li>
                    <li>Skim off any excess fat from the liquid in the pot.</li>
                    <li>Return the pot to the stove and add the remaining broth, the carrots, beets, and potato. Add the chopped meat to the pot, the sliced cabbage, and a half cup of the fresh dill. Bring to a simmer, and cook for another 15 minutes or so, until the cabbage is cooked through.</li>
                    <li>Add the vinegar and season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
